This project is part of my Udacity Nanodegree Program. This is Capstone project in which I have performed sentiment analysis 
on IMDB dataset. 

### Source Code
1. Imdb.py: This class provides re-usable methods to load dataset and perform some pre-processing task on the reviews.
2. naive-bayes.ipynb: Sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes classification.
3. rnn-lstm-sentiment.ipynb: Sentiment analysis using RNN/LSTM. ( I support this most ) 

### How to Run
Before running ipynb files ensure that the appropriate file is placed inside dataset directory. 
Else, modify the path of dataset in the respective ipynb files.

### Software Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Tensorflow 1.7
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Nltk
